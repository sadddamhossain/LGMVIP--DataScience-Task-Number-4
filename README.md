# LGMVIP--DataScience-Task-Number-4
# Using iris dataset create Decision tree Model
1. Import necessary libraries: Import pandas, scikit-learn, and any other required libraries.
2. Load the Iris dataset: Use scikit-learn to load the Iris dataset.
3. Prepare the data: Split the dataset into features (X) and target labels (y).
4. Split the data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
5. Create a Decision Tree Classifier: Instantiate a DecisionTreeClassifier.
6. Train the model: Fit the Decision Tree Classifier to the training data using the fit method.
7. Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict the target labels on the test data.
8. Evaluate the model: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
9. Visualize the Decision Tree: Visualize the decision tree for insights using graphviz or other tools.
10. Fine-tune the model (optional): Adjust hyperparameters for better performance.
11. Save and deploy (optional): Save the model for future use or deploy it in an application.
